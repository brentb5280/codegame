User Story
-AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers-

Criteria
-GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score-

What I did 
-I created the HTML and the CSS 
-Added the Javascript last because it seemed easier 
-I researched the best way to structure this and putting the questions on a seperateJavascript page was the best suggestion 
-added the Questions Javascript next
-Last was the timer, I had to research how to do this because itwas propabbly the hardest part.
